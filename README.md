# 2D Object Detection for Self-Driving Cars

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing a 2D object detection system for self-driving cars. The primary goal is to detect and classify various objects such as vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs, and other road elements using computer vision techniques. This system ensures improved situational awareness, safety, and decision-making capabilities for autonomous vehicles.

## Features
- Detection and classification of objects in real-time.
- Support for common object categories like cars, buses and trucks.
- Efficient and optimized models suitable for embedded systems.
- Visualization of bounding boxes and labels on detected objects.
- Scalable for integration with other modules in self-driving cars.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Deep Learning Framework:** TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Object Detection Models:** YOLO (You Only Look Once)
- **Tools and Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Dataset:** lyft_3d_recognition, Lyft 3D Object Detection for Autonomous.
